Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple form of data compression where runs 
of data (sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive 
data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as 
the original run. This is most efficient on data that contains many such runs.

For example:
WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

Can be compressed to:
12W1B12W3B24W1B14W

RLE can achieve good compression ratios on certain types of data.
