The Move-to-Front transform is a simple but clever encoding technique.
It converts repeated characters into sequences of small numbers, which
compress very well with RLE and Huffman coding. This makes it perfect
for use after the Burrows-Wheeler Transform in compression pipelines
like bzip2. The algorithm maintains a dynamic list of all possible
byte values and moves accessed bytes to the front of the list.
